# uCISC Introduction

uCISC (pronounced like micro-sisk or myoo-sisk) is a small, complex instruction
set for general purpose personal hobby computing that can scale from
micro-controllers to personal computers. This is a hobby for fun, not profit. That
said, I do want to explore the idea of what modern computing would look like if we
re-imagined it on a 16-bit computer and threw away 90% of the complexity of modern
computing.

If you want to know more about why I'm doing this, you can start at the
[Beginning](02_Beginnings.md). I start from a little bit of back story and walk
through most of the design decisions that have become inevitable in the process,
even if I didn't undertand them at the outset.

You can skip ahead to [Banking Mechanics](08_Banking_Mechanics.md) if you want the
nerdy details of the end result. Or if you just want to get into some code, jump all
the way to the [Syntax](12_Syntax.md).

I must give vast amounts of credit to Kartik Agaram. I started down this journey
independently, but he has been instrumental in helping me come so far so quicky. At
some point a colleague of my saw one of his blog posts on hacker news about
[Mu: A minimal hobbyist computing stack](http://akkartik.name/post/mu-2019-1) and
recognized I would be interested. The rest, as they say, is history, and I am
unbelievably grateful to his advice, critiques and motivating influence.
